Creating a third-party library that extends Zustand's functionality is a great way to add custom features. Here are some pointers to guide you:

Start with a new project:

Initialize a new npm package [DONE]
Set up your development environment (TypeScript is recommended) [DONE]


Add Zustand as a peer dependency: [DONE]

This ensures users of your library also install Zustand [DONE]


Design your API:

Decide what new features you want to add
Plan how users will interact with your library 


Extend Zustand's functionality:

Create wrapper functions around Zustand's core methods
Add your custom logic and features


Use TypeScript for better type safety:

Extend Zustand's types to include your additions


Write tests:

Ensure your library works as expected
Test integration with Zustand


Document your library:

Provide clear usage instructions and examples


Publish your package:

Prepare your package for npm
Publish it to the npm registry
